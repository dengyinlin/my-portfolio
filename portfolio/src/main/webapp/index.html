      <p>I was born in 1999 in Guangdong, and my animal zodiac is rabbit.</p>

      <p>I am currently a fourth-year student majoring in Computer Science. 
          I have broad range of interest ranging from machine learning, algorithms 
          to computational neural-science.
          As far as my individual interests, I started playing volleyball in high school 
          and volleyball has given me a lot to love and appreciate ever since.
